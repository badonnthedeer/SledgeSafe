SledgeSafe is a small mod that allows the use of sledgehammers in multiplayer without endangering safehouses!

[h1]Details[/h1]
[list]
[*]A player that isn't part of a safehouse won't be able to destroy it. They will, however, be able to destroy unowned buildings!
[*]A player that is an owner of a safehouse will always be able to destroy it using a sledgehammer.
[*]Members of a safehouse are allowed to destroy a safehouse given the sandbox option "Safehouse Members Can Sledge" is turned on!
[*]Admins of servers can destroy any part of any safehouse.
