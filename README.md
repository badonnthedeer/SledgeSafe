SledgeSafe is a mod that allows the use of the sledgehammer item on multiplayer servers while keeping safehouses free from griefing.

If a player is not a member of a safehouse, they won't be able to use their sledgehammer on items or tiles the safehouse has claimed.

If a player IS a member of a safehouse, they may optionally be allowed to use the sledgehammer.

Owners of safehouses are always allowed to use the sledgehammer.

Lastly, use of the sledgehammer shouldn't be affected outside safehouses.
